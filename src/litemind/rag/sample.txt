# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing systems that learn from data.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where each example has an input and a corresponding output.

### Classification

Classification is a supervised learning task where the output is a categorical variable.

### Regression

Regression is a supervised learning task where the output is a continuous variable.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning involves training a model on an unlabeled dataset, where the examples have inputs but no corresponding outputs.

### Clustering

Clustering is an unsupervised learning task that involves grouping similar examples.

### Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction is an unsupervised learning task that involves reducing the number of input variables.
